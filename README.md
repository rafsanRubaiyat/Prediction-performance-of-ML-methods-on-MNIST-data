# Prediction-performance-of-ML-methods-on-MNIST-data
I have evaluated the prediction performance of different ML methods: Multinomial Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests, Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Deep Neural Networks on classifying the digits of the MNIST dataset with tuning and validation.
